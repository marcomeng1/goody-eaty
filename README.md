My Menu at 80807 SCHWABING-MUNICH -- Version 0.1 powered by my virtue
### Description
It is a user guide for how to make life fantastic
(ok, it is about the possible dishes THE Chinese Guy gonna prepare and to show you guys in advance what possible shaddy stuff can be inside.)

### What you gonna do
The following dishes are possible dish-selection within my cooking abilities. Only a few dishes will be selected in the final around. Write dish-numbers in the [Issue](https://github.com/marcomeng1/goody-eaty/issues) that you prefer, although I decides finally the serving food. It is a life and you have to admit it, just same as the demoracy in my country.
