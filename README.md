My Menu at 80807 SCHWABING-MUNICH -- Version 0.1 powered by my internal peace and love
### Description
It is a user guide for how to make our christmas party fantastic
(ok, it is nothing but a menu about the possible dishes that THE Chinese Guy gonna prepare and show you guys in advance what possible shaddy stuff can be inside.)

### What you gonna do
The following dishes are possible dish-selection within my cooking abilities. Only a few dishes will be selected in the final around. Write dish-numbers in the [Issue](https://github.com/marcomeng1/goody-eaty/issues) that you prefer, although I decide finally on dishes. Come on, stop yelling. It is just the life and you have to admit it, just same as the demoracy in my country.
